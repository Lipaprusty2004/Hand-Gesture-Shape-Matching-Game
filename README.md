# Hand-Gesture-Shape-Matching-Game
A fun computer vision game using OpenCV and MediaPipe where you can drag and drop shapes with your hand gestures. Pinch with thumb and index finger to pick shapes, move them to target zones, and get instant feedback: “MATCH” in green for correct or “NOT MATCH” in red for wrong.
